## Technical Exercise for Off Madison Ave Pre-Employment Process

#### Requirements (copied from email)

1. You must establish a fresh Git repository for the project. The resulting Git history should be extensive enough for us to get a sense of how you work. Commit often and make appropriate commit comments.
2. Implement the Photoshop design as a web page. It is not required that you make the result responsive for every major breakpoint.
3. Implement the subscription form at the bottom of the page. The fields should be validated on the client-side and the data collected by your API. The data collected should be persisted to a database or document. A submission should provide visual feedback to the user of the successful or failed result.
4. Pick at least one portion of content on the page and have that content be provided by your API.
5. You must push all of the source to a publicly available repository on GitHub.
6. You must publish the final result to a publicly available server/cloud platform such as Heroku.

You may use any open source library or framework to assist in completing this project, but you may not use a SaaS platform such as Firebase. It’s more important that the features you wish to complete are fully-functional/polished than the features you may choose to leave incomplete.
